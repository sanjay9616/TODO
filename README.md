# TODO

This project will be implemented using different technologies and approaches to deepen my understanding of state management techniques and compare the simplicity, scalability, and performance of various libraries and frameworks.

1. **Vanilla JS**: Implement the core functionality using pure JavaScript to enhance basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and handling of local storage or state management manually.


2. **NgRX**: Refactor the project to use NgRX, a state management library for Angular applications, to handle the application's state. This will help in learning state management patterns, actions, reducers, and effects in Angular.

3. **Context API**: Implement the project using React's Context API for managing the applicationâ€™s state in a way that avoids prop drilling and provides global state access across components.

4. **Redux**: Refactor the project to use Redux for more advanced state management in React. This will involve working with actions, reducers, and the Redux store.

# Key Features

- **Add Tasks:** Allows users to add new tasks with a title and description, automatically assigning a unique ID and displaying them in a table.
- **Delete Tasks**: Provides the ability to delete tasks, removing them from the task list and the displayed table.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks by clicking the "edit" button, which prompts them to enter a new task value.
- **Sorting Tasks**: Tasks can be sorted by task name or creation date, making it easier for users to manage and view tasks in a preferred order.
